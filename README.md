# Account_Server

This is a Spring Boot back-end application designed to manage a virtual cash balance for multiple users. This was built as an extension to [my frontend investment environment](https://tppersonalcapstone.web.app/). It replaces some of the microservices designed by other devs in our shared [Condor Financial](https://condor-financial.web.app/) portfolio project.

Ultimately, the goal of this project was just to familiarize myself with Spring Boot architecture and refresh my skill with Java.
